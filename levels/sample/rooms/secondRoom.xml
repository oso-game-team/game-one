<!-- This file describes the first room. Normally I break each room into its
own self-contained file. This isn't fundamentally necessary, but it's very
natural. It also allows you to very easily load content only once a room 
is entered for the first time. -->

		<!-- here we're adding in our BG and FG. This is the second half of our

		specify that this image has been sliced up into tiles. Then we just specify
		how many there are and how big they are, and the system will find all of them
		and tile them correctly based on their names. This also makes it very easy
		to transition from using one big image to a sliced up one. -->
