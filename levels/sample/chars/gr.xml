a character entails, including their specification, common actions, dialogsprites

	Characters use a single sprite sheet to describe eight different animations, 
	and therefore need a lot of parameters to properly describe themselves.
	Characters are by default depth='1' (in the midground). -->

			@posty_neutraltalk Hey, how's it going?
			@gr_idle ...
			@gr_sadtalk OK, I guess.
			@posty_neutraltalk Hey, can you help me out? I don't think that blue guy will let me through. Maybe you'll be able to convince him to move out of the way.
            @gr_sadtalk Oh...I don't know...I'm pretty nervous.
            @posty_neutraltalk Don't worry, you got this! You just gotta believe!
            @gr_idle ...
            @gr_happytalk Yeah, you're right. I can do this.
			@! You can now switch to Green Rectangle.
            @! At least you can after you program this, FUNNYBOY. Gosh, you're lazy!
