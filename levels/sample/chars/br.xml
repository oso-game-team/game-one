a character entails, including their specification, common actions, dialogsprites

	<!-- The description of this character (see usage in rooms/firstRoom.xml). 
	Characters use a single sprite sheet to describe eight different animations, 
	and therefore need a lot of parameters to properly describe themselves.
	Characters are by default depth='1' (in the midground). -->

			@posty_neutraltalk Ummmmm...hi?
            @br_neutraltalk Yo diggity dawg! Whazzup?
            @posty_neutraltalk I'm OK, thanks.
            @br_neutraltalk Poggers.
            @posty_neutraltalk Hey, do you think you could move out of the way? I need to get into the next room.
            @br_neutraltalk Nah, bro. Only the lit and radical make it past me. No offense.
            @posty_neutraltalk None taken. But can you make an exception at least once?
            @br_neutraltalk  Sorry. Maybe if you got someone else to convince me to move, I would. But until then, hang loose.
